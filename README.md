Codebase and documentation for the WSU UI Pattern Library

## UI Module Pattern Library
This is a collection of UI Modules and associated styles commonly used on the Weber State University website.

It is an extension of the wsu-main.css styles.

## Motivation
This library was developed to allow quick implimentation of UI web modules, which will greatly reduce build time and increase consistency across the site.

### Tech and Frameworks Used
1. Uses [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for css preprocessing
2. Sits on top of [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) framework
3. Extends the Weber State University [UI Style Guide](https://www.weber.edu/uistyleguide/default.html)
