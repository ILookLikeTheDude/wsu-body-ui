Codebase and documentation for the WSU UI Pattern Library

## UI Module Pattern Library
This is a collection of UI Modules and associated styles commonly used on the Weber State University website by Marketing and Communications department.

It is an extension of the wsu-main.css styles.

## Motivation
This library was developed to allow quick implementation of UI web modules, which will greatly reduce build time and increase consistency across the site.

### Tech and Frameworks Used
1. Uses [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for css pre-processing
2. Sits on top of [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) framework
3. Extends the Weber State University [UI Style Guide](https://www.weber.edu/uistyleguide/default.html)

## Documentation
Complete documentation currently lives as these [google docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RqIUhGGq8k7rJWha4bTP1fAhZFGYLEZT?usp=sharing)

## Conventions
1. Using [Semantic Versioning 2.0] (https://semver.org/) for version names and release conventions.
2. Commit messages will conform to [Conventional Commits] (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) starting June 25th, 2019
