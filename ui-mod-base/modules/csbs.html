                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Growing up in Roy as part of a two-parent household, <strong>Lauren Navidomskis BS &rsquo;15</strong>, the new executive director of Ogden&rsquo;s Lantern House homeless shelter, said she was &ldquo;blind to what real life was like.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>While she attended WSU on a full-ride track and field scholarship, her eyes opened to the many hardships others face, and she gained a passion for social work and community agencies that help people.</p>

            <p>She first visited Lantern House after being assigned a 20-hour volunteer service project in a Weber State course. In a child and family studies course, she visited about 10 local agencies. Through these experiences, she recalls thinking, &ldquo;I could see myself working here. I can see the need.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Thanks to a senior-year internship with the Your Community Connection (YCC) Family Crisis Center, she landed a job as a caseworker with the organization after graduating. Now, at 26, she&rsquo;s a leader at a local agency.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m young, but I am trained and equipped to handle this,&rdquo; Navidomskis said about her new duties. &ldquo;I love my colleagues; I love our clients. This is their home. People pass away here. They grow here. They fall off the wagon here. We are giving guidance and hope. We are a beacon of light for those in need.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Navidomskis plans to pay forward what she gained at Weber State by interacting with the social work students professor <strong>Steven Vigil</strong> brings to the center three times a year, and expanding internship opportunities.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Weber State does a phenomenal job of capturing our community,&rdquo; Navidomskis said. &ldquo;I was so proud to wear that name on my chest when I competed in high jump. I want to continue to support its activities and continue to bleed purple.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">A History Degree, A Bright Future&nbsp;</h2>

            <div>
                <p>When <strong>Austin Nelsen BA &rsquo;19</strong> delivered the student speech at Weber State&rsquo;s 2019 spring commencement, his son Hamilton was less than a week old. As Hamilton grows up, Nelsen plans to tell his son about WSU, and the degree that changed his world.</p>

                <p>As part of his senior thesis, Nelsen received a grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research to visit Lisbon, Portugal, and its archive of a fugitive slave community established in the 1600s.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Every minute in the archive was simply thrilling, and with every 400-year-old letter or manuscript the archivists handed me, I felt like I was opening presents on Christmas morning,&rdquo; Nelsen said.</p>

                <p>The College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences honored Nelsen as its Most Outstanding Student Researcher and author of the Best History Thesis of 2019.</p>

                <p>Nelsen wants to continue his exploration of how power, race and class played out in Europe between the 15th and late 18th centuries. Eventually, he hopes to earn his Ph.D. and become a college professor to help others achieve their dreams.</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">Top Honors for New History Faculty Member&nbsp;</h2>

            <div>
                <p>The Society of American Historians selected the work of Weber State&rsquo;s newest history faculty member for the 59th annual Allan Nevins Prize.</p>

                <p><strong>Jonathan Lande</strong> was honored for his dissertation, Disciplining Freedom: U.S. Army Slave Rebels and Emancipation in the Civil War. He reviewed more than 30,000 transcripts of Civil War military courts martial in the National Archives. What Lande found was that a military organization committed to the destruction of slavery unwittingly subjected black soldiers to the violent discipline and coerced labor that many formerly enslaved Americans sought to escape.</p>

                <p>The award came with $2,000 and the guaranteed publication of his work into a book.</p>

                <p>Lande earned his Ph.D. at Brown University and completed a postdoctoral fellow at the New-York Historical Society and the Lang College Department of History at The New School.</p>

                <p>He began teaching at Weber State in fall 2019; one of his courses is a new history class on African-American leaders.</p>
